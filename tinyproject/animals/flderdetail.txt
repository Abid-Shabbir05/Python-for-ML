__init__.py in Python — Summary
🔹 What is it?

A special Python file named __init__.py.

Lives inside a folder.

Makes Python treat that folder as a package.

Can be empty or contain code.

🔹 When do we use it?

When you want to organize code into a package (instead of keeping everything in one big .py file).

Always create it when building your own package.

Optional in modern Python (≥3.3), but still used for clarity and control.

🔹 What happens after creating it?

The folder becomes a package → you can now import it.

If empty → it just marks the folder as a package.

If not empty → any code inside runs when the package is imported.

You can import submodules/functions automatically.

Define constants or metadata.

Run initialization/setup code.

🔹 Typical code inside __init__.py

Expose functions/classes for easy imports
