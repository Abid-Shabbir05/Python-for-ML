# Conditional statements in Python allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. 
# The main conditional statements are:

# 1️⃣ if Statement
# Executes a block of code only if the condition is True.

n = 18
if n >= 18 :
    print("can vote & apply for license")

# 2️⃣ if-else Statement
# Executes one block if the condition is True, otherwise executes another block.

n = 20 
if n > 20:
    print("able to marry")
else:
    print("not able to marry")
 
# 3️⃣ if-elif-else Statement
# Checks multiple conditions in sequence.

light = "green"
if(light == "green"):
    print("can go")
elif(light == "red"):
    print("stop")
elif(light == "yellow"):
    print("be ready")
else:
    print("system not working")

# 4️⃣ Nested if Statements
# Using an if inside another if.
