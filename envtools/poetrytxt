===========================  Poetry =============================================
Poetry is a tool for managing Python projects.
It handles everything in one place:

Virtual environments (like venv)

Dependencies (like pip install)

Packaging & distribution (like setup.py / requirements.txt)
Without Poetry:

You create a venv manually.

You install dependencies with pip install.

You manually keep a requirements.txt.

You manually build packages with setup.py.

With Poetry:

Poetry creates & manages the environment for you.

You add dependencies with poetry add ....

It automatically tracks them in pyproject.toml.

It builds a distribution (.whl, .tar.gz) easily.


how to use it======================?

# Install poetry (once)
pip install poetry

# Create new project
poetry new myproject

# Move into project folder
cd myproject

# Add a dependency
poetry add requests

How to activate the environment in Poetry 2.x==================== ?
🔹 How to activate the environment in Poetry 2.x

Check which virtual environment Poetry created

poetry env list


You’ll see something like:

myproject-py3.10 (Activated)


Activate it

poetry env activate <path-to-venv>


Or simply (recommended):

poetry env info


It shows the path, e.g.:

Path: /home/abidshabbir/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-py3.10


Then activate it manually:

source /home/abidshabbir/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-py3.10/bin/activate
