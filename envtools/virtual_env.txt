python enviroment is basically an isolated or seperate workplace that contain 
.. A specific interpreter version
..it own installed pakages
..is own setting
This isolation prevents conflicts between different projects. For example:
Project A may need numpy==1.21
Project B may need numpy==1.26

or

Think of a Python environment like a separate box (workspace) where your Python projects live.
Inside that box, you can keep:
A specific Python version (e.g., Python 3.9, Python 3.10).
All the libraries (like numpy, pandas, tensorflow) that project needs.
Each box (environment) is isolated, meaning:
The libraries in one project won’t affect another project.
Different projects can use different versions of Python or libraries without conflict.

why use it =======?
Because without environments, everything gets installed globally on your computer, and problems happen:
Project A may need numpy==1.21 but Project B needs numpy==1.25.
If installed globally, they’ll fight each other and break things.
Environments solve this by keeping separate boxes for each project.


When do we use it?
When starting a new project → create a new environment.
When you want to test code with different Python versions.
When working on Machine Learning or big projects → because they require many different libraries, and versions matter a lot.

Globally means:
When you install Python packages without an environment, they go into the main Python installation of your system.
This is called the global environment.
It’s like putting everything into one big toolbox that all projects must share.
