==========What is pipenv? ===============

pipenv is a tool that manages both virtual environments and packages at the same time.
It was created to make Python project setup easier and cleaner.
Instead of using venv + pip separately, you just use pipenv.
What does pipenv do?
Creates a virtual environment automatically (like venv/virtualenv).
Installs packages using pip under the hood.
Keeps track of dependencies in two files:
Pipfile → lists which packages your project needs.
Pipfile.lock → locks exact versions (for reproducibility).
