======================What is conda? ===================

conda is both:
A package manager (like pip), and
An environment manager (like venv/virtualenv).
So it’s an all-in-one tool that can create environments and install packages into them.
🔹 Why is conda special?
It’s not limited to Python → it can install Python packages and non-Python packages (like C libraries, R, CUDA for GPUs, compilers, etc).
This makes it super popular in Data Science and Machine Learning where you often need system-level libraries (e.g., TensorFlow + CUDA drivers).
