======================================  PiP  ==============
pip stands for “Pip Installs Packages” (some also say Pip Installs Python).
It is the default package manager for Python.
With pip, you can download and install Python libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI) into your environment.
Is pip built into Python 3?
Yes ✅ — since Python 3.4, pip comes bundled with Python by default.
That means when you install Python 3, you usually get pip automatically.
If it’s missing, you can install it manually (with get-pip.py script or your package manager like apt).
🔹 What does pip do?
pip is not part of the Python Standard Library (like math, os, sys).
Instead, it is a separate tool/module that ships with Python, so it’s available right away.
Its job is to install and manage external packages (from PyPI – Python Package Index
), which are not included in standard Python.
