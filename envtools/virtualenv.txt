What is virtualenv?

virtualenv is a Python tool (a package) that creates isolated environments for Python projects.

It was the older way to make environments before Python added the built-in venv module.

So:

venv → comes built into Python 3.3+ (no need to install).

virtualenv → a separate package (you install it with pip install virtualenv), but it works on both Python 2 and Python 3.
Why use virtualenv?

Before Python 3.3, there was no built-in venv, so developers used virtualenv.

Even today, some people still prefer it because:

It has more features than venv (like faster environment creation, better cross-version support).

It can create environments for both Python 2 and Python 3.

how it install=====?
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source/myenv/bin/activate
